# Blinkit-Data-Analysis
 step-by-step SQL playbook that cleans key categorical fields and delivers headline KPIs such as total sales, average sales, order count, and ratings. It then dives deeper with pivoted queries by fat content, item type, location, outlet age, and size

See all the data imported:
SELECT * FROM blinkit_data

DATA CLEANING:
Cleaning the Item_Fat_Content field ensures data consistency and accuracy in analysis. The presence of multiple variations of the same category (e.g., LF, low fat vs. Low Fat) can cause issues in reporting, aggregations, and filtering. By standardizing these values, we improve data quality, making it easier to generate insights and maintain uniformity in our datasets.

UPDATE blinkit_data
SET Item_Fat_Content = 
    CASE 
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content IN ('LF', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE Item_Fat_Content
    END;

	After executing this query check the data has been cleaned or not using below query
	SELECT DISTINCT Item_Fat_Content FROM blinkit_data;

A. KPIâ€™s

1. The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

       SELECT CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) / 1000000.0 AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales_Million
       FROM blinkit_data;
 
2. AVERAGE SALES:The average revenue per sale.
       SELECT CAST(AVG(Total_Sales) AS INT) AS Avg_Sales
       FROM blinkit_data;
 
3. NO OF ITEMS: The total count of different items sold.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_of_Orders
FROM blinkit_data;
 
4. AVG RATING:The average customer rating for items sold.
SELECT CAST(AVG(Rating) AS DECIMAL(10,1)) AS Avg_Rating
FROM blinkit_data;
 

B. Total Sales by Fat Content: 
SELECT Item_Fat_Content, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Item_Fat_Content
 

C. Total Sales by Item Type
SELECT Item_Type, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Item_Type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
 
D. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
SELECT Outlet_Location_Type, 
       ISNULL([Low Fat], 0) AS Low_Fat, 
       ISNULL([Regular], 0) AS Regular
FROM 
(
    SELECT Outlet_Location_Type, Item_Fat_Content, 
           CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
    FROM blinkit_data
    GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type, Item_Fat_Content
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT 
(
    SUM(Total_Sales) 
    FOR Item_Fat_Content IN ([Low Fat], [Regular])
) AS PivotTable
ORDER BY Outlet_Location_Type;

 
Query Explanations
This query aims to transform the blinkit_data table to display total sales (Total_Sales) for each combination of Outlet_Location_Type and Item_Fat_Content. The result will show Outlet_Location_Type as rows and Item_Fat_Content categories ("Low Fat" and "Regular") as columns. If there are no sales for a particular combination, the query will display 0 instead of NULL.

E. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment
SELECT Outlet_Establishment_Year, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Establishment_Year
ORDER BY Outlet_Establishment_Year
 

F. Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size
SELECT 
    Outlet_Size, 
    CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales,
    CAST((SUM(Total_Sales) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(Total_Sales)) OVER()) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Sales_Percentage
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Size
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;

G. Sales by Outlet Location
SELECT Outlet_Location_Type, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
 
H. All Metrics by Outlet Type:
SELECT Outlet_Type, 
CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales,
		CAST(AVG(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,0)) AS Avg_Sales,
		COUNT(*) AS No_Of_Items,
		CAST(AVG(Rating) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Rating,
		CAST(AVG(Item_Visibility) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Item_Visibility
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
